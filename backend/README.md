# Smart Learning Agent Backend

FastAPI backend for the Smart Learning Agent project. The codebase is organized as a kernel-managed plugin system: shared infrastructure belongs to the kernel, and learning scenarios live in plugins.

## Local setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Configure the built-in Agent:

   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI-compatible model key.
   - `OPENAI_BASE_URL`: compatible endpoint base. For `api.mhapi.cn`, use
     `https://api.mhapi.cn` without `/v1`.
   - `OPENAI_MODEL`: a model that supports image input for scene 1.
   - `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT`: Responses reasoning level, such as `xhigh`; use `none`
     for models that do not support the Responses `reasoning` option.

   The kernel uses raw HTTP with the OpenAI Responses wire protocol. It does not use the
   OpenAI Python SDK because some compatible gateways reject the SDK request fingerprint.

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. Apply database migrations (required for both new and existing databases):

   ```bash
   uv run alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. Run the API:

   ```bash
   uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

The API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Architecture

- `app/kernel`: application startup, configuration, database, audit logging, background jobs, auth, LLM gateway, Agent runtime, RAG and knowledge graph interfaces, plugin loading, and response envelopes.
- `app/plugins`: business capabilities loaded by the kernel at startup.
- `app/plugins/example`: reference plugin for backend developers.
- `docs/plugin-development.md`: plugin rules and extension guide.
- `../API接口文档.md`: frozen Chinese frontend API contract.
- `docs/api.md`: backend-directory index pointing to the frozen contract.
- `docs/builtin-agent.md`: built-in LangGraph flows, verification policy, and sandbox boundary.
- `docs/deployment.md`: backend and MySQL Docker Compose deployment.
- `docs/evaluation.md`: automated evidence and real-sample evaluation template.

## Current plugins

- `example`: documents the plugin contract.
- `mastery_tracking`: knowledge points and mastery records.
- `wrong_question_book`: wrong question archive.
- `assignment_grading`: homework upload, multimodal grading, and manual correction.
- `layered_practice`: weak-point practice generation and submission grading.
- `learning_dashboard`: composed student dashboard.

## Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```
